## Disclosure Policy

When the Orkes team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

*   Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
*   Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
*   Prepare fixes for all releases that are still under maintenance. These fixes
    will be kept in a private branch of the repository until the public
    disclosure.

We will not disclose the vulnerability until a fix is available.
